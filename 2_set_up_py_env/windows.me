1. **Installing Python (latest version):** Visit the official Python website (python.org) and download the latest version of Python for Windows. Run the installer and be sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation. This makes it easier to run Python from the command line.

2. **Choosing a code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** You've got options on Windows:
   - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** It's a versatile and free code editor. You can download it from code.visualstudio.com and install Python extensions for a smoother experience.
   - **PyCharm:** JetBrains offers a Windows version of PyCharm, which is a powerful Python IDE. You can get the free community edition or the paid professional edition.

3. **Setting up a virtual environment:** On Windows, you can create and activate a virtual environment as follows:
   - Create a virtual environment: Open Command Prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run:
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
     Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name.
   - Activate the environment: In Command Prompt, navigate to your project directory and run:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Using package managers like pip:** You'll use pip for package management. Upgrade pip first:
   ```
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
   Then, install packages as needed:
   ```
   pip install package-name
   ```
